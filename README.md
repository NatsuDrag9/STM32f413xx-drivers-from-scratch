# STM32f413xx-drivers-from-scratch

The drivers for the following peripherals in any STM32F413XX are implemented:\
1.) GPIOx (x = A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H)\
2.) SPIx (x = 1, 2, 3, 4)\
3.) I2Cx (x = 1, 2, 3)\
4.) USARTx (x = 1, 2, 3, 6)\
5.) UARTx (x = 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10)\

Th MCU header file usr_stm32f413xx.h at ./drivers/inc/ contains:\
1.) Base addresses of flash, SRAM1, ROM, peripheral buses and the various peripherals\
2.) Peripheral register definition structure and peripheral definitions\
3.) System clock and peripheral clock enable/disable\
4.) Peripheral interrupt position number in the vector table\
5.) Bit positions of various registers for all peripherals\

The header file for peripheral driver implementation at ./drivers/inc/ contains:\
1.) Peripheral handle structure\
2.) Peripheral configuration structure\
3.) API prototypes\
4.) And macros for various modes that need to be configured\

The drivers were tested on STM32F413ZH Nucleo-144 containing ARM Cortex M4 and the communication protocols were tested with an Arduino Uno Rev3.
