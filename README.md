# STM32f413xx-drivers-from-scratch

To run the code:

1.) Install STM32CubeIDE from [here](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)<br />
2.) Clone the repo and change to the ```code``` directory<br />
3.) Build and run the project using the IDE

The drivers were tested on STM32F413ZH Nucleo-144 containing ARM Cortex M4 and the communication protocols were tested with an Arduino Uno Rev3. So, I cannot guarantee for other MCUs.
