# STM32f413xx-drivers-from-scratch

The drivers for the following peripherals in any STM32F413XX are implemented:
1.) GPIOx (x = A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H)
2.) SPIx (x = 1, 2, 3, 4)
3.) I2Cx (x = 1, 2, 3)
4.) USARTx (x = 1, 2, 3, 6)
5.) UARTx (x = 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10)

Th MCU header file usr_stm32f413xx.h at ./drivers/inc/ contains:
1.) Base addresses of flash, SRAM1, ROM, peripheral buses and the various peripherals
2.) Peripheral register definition structure and peripheral definitions
3.) System clock and peripheral clock enable/disable
4.) Peripheral interrupt position number in the vector table
5.) Bit positions of various registers for all peripherals

The header file for peripheral driver implementation at ./drivers/inc/ contains:
1.) Peripheral handle structure
2.) Peripheral configuration structure
3.) API prototypes
4.) And macros for various modes that need to be configured

The drivers were tested on STM32F413ZH Nucleo-144 containing ARM Cortex M4.The reference manual RM0430 for ARM cortex M4 can be found [https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f413zh.html#documentation)https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f413zh.html#documentation](here). The links to the user manual and datasheet for the board are [usermanual]([url](https://www.digikey.ch/htmldatasheets/production/2264408/0/0/1/stm32-nucleo-144-user-manual.html)https://www.digikey.ch/htmldatasheets/production/2264408/0/0/1/stm32-nucleo-144-user-manual.html) and [datasheet]([url](https://datasheetspdf.com/datasheet/STM32F413ZH.html)https://datasheetspdf.com/datasheet/STM32F413ZH.html) repectively. I couldn't find all the documents on the board's product page at ST's official website.
